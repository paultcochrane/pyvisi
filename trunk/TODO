  (added 2004-11-19, 14:33, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

  (added 2004-11-19, 14:03, incomplete, priority high)

- View a contour plot similar to contour() of Matlab
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:05, incomplete, priority high)

- convert numarrays to vtk structuredData objects
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:30, incomplete, priority high)

- Get shaded contour plots working
  (added 2004-11-24, 13:34, incomplete, priority high)

- Get installation process working so that when pyvisi actually has features
  users can install it easily
  (added 2005-01-10, 13:18, incomplete, priority high)

- Fully implement linestyles in renderers.gnuplot
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:44, incomplete, priority high)

- Fully implement linestyles in renderers.vtk
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:44, incomplete, priority high)

- Add proper write() methods so that can actually output scenes to file
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:47, incomplete, priority high)

- Add a single curve, single data example, and implement.  Single data meaning
  that the x data is just the indices of the y data given.
  (added 2005-01-24, 14:40, incomplete, priority high)

- Write up student project description
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:03, incomplete, priority medium)

- Convert escript Data objects into relevant vtk objects
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:04, incomplete, priority medium)

- Implement add()-ing objects to a scene without them being rendered or added
  directly at instantiation
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:29, incomplete, priority medium)

- scene.add() could do a _renderer.AddActor(obj) and rest of code just sets up
  the actor
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:30, incomplete, priority medium)

- use a numarray to generate a mesh plot
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:31, incomplete, priority medium)

- use a numarray to generate a surf plot
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:31, incomplete, priority medium)

- Start writing docs for the api so that other developers can contribute more
  easily
  (added 2005-01-10, 13:19, incomplete, priority medium)

- Might need some kind of renderer module templating system for developers to
  work from.
  (added 2005-01-11, 14:50, incomplete, priority medium)

- Move new method and class definitions from developing renderer modules into
  the base classes as they get added.  This is so that the interface that new
  renderer module writers should be writing to override, or at least meet, is in
  place.
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:20, incomplete, priority medium)

- Need a log output file for user- and developer- debugging information.
  (added 2005-01-21, 14:09, incomplete, priority medium)

- At present, can only have one kind of linestyle per graph.  We need a way to
  specify different linestyles for each individual line on a multi-line graph if
  desired.
  (added 2005-01-24, 15:56, incomplete, priority medium)

- View a 2D vector field as an Arrow Plot
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:04, incomplete, priority low)

  (added 2004-11-19, 14:04, incomplete, priority low)

- View a 3D surface plot similar to surf() of Matlab
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:04, incomplete, priority low)

- work out conceptual differences between a mesh plot (in matlab sense) and a
  mesh in a mesh generator sense
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:32, incomplete, priority low)

- work out concept of line data for fault systems; is it a LinePlot or what is
  it?
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:33, incomplete, priority low)

- Get BallPlots working in vtk
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:45, incomplete, priority low)

- Get BallPlots working in povray
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:45, incomplete, priority low)

- Once BallPlots are working in vtk, add renderers.povray and flesh out with
  base objects and files etc.
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:46, incomplete, priority low)

- Will need sections in the manual for the docs about each renderer module, or
  possibly each module supplies their own.
