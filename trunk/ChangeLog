	* pyvisi/__init__.py: Displaying revision number in startup
	  informative information.

2005-01-12 14:22  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/common.py: Added a revision number.

2005-01-11 19:13  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: camera.py, image.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py: Implemented warning users if a method is called without
	  having been overriden.

2005-01-11 19:13  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/common.py: Added a function to display a warning message
	  when a method is used but hasn't been overridden by the renderer
	  module.

2005-01-11 18:28  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Added better wording in warning message.

2005-01-11 18:26  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Added warnings if the base level methods are
	  ever used, and giving the user advice as to what to do if they
	  see the warning.

2005-01-11 17:51  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/renderer.py: Removed the
	  setRenderWindowWidth, setRenderWindowHeight,
	  getRenderWindowWidth, getRenderWindowHeight, getEvalStack,
	  addToEvalSTack and resetEvalStack methods as they are provided by
	  the base class, so pointless overriding them in this case.

2005-01-11 17:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/axes.py: Expanded the doc strings to say that this is just
	  an abstract class and needs to be overridden.  Put the print
	  statement into an if _debug:

2005-01-11 17:29  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py, renderers/vtk/camera.py, renderers/vtk/image.py,
	  renderers/vtk/item.py, renderers/vtk/renderer.py,
	  renderers/vtk/scene.py: Fixed formatting errors in docstrings.

2005-01-11 15:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/scene.py: Fixed problem with an if loop not actually doing
	  anything inside.

2005-01-11 15:20  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: camera.py, image.py, plane.py, renderer.py, scene.py:
	  Removed vtk code from base code.  Fixed obsolete references to
	  renderer names and renderer objects from when used to pass the
	  renderer name etc into the Scene object at instatiation time.
	  Fixed some other minor bugs.

2005-01-11 15:10  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/povray/tests/: test_axes.py, test_camera.py,
	  test_image.py, test_item.py, test_plane.py, test_plot.py,
	  test_renderer.py, test_scene.py, test_text.py: Initial import to
	  repository.  These are the skeleton test files for the povray
	  renderer module.

2005-01-11 15:09  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/povray/: __init__.py, axes.py, camera.py,
	  common.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py, text.py: Initial import to repository.  These are the
	  skeleton files for the povray renderer module.

2005-01-11 15:07  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/tests/: test_axes.py, test_camera.py,
	  test_image.py, test_item.py, test_plane.py, test_plot.py,
	  test_renderer.py, test_scene.py, test_text.py: Initial import to
	  repository.  These are the skeleton test files for the gnuplot
	  renderer module.

2005-01-11 15:07  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/: __init__.py, axes.py, camera.py,
	  common.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py, text.py: Initial import to repository.  These are the
	  skeleton files for the gnuplot renderer module.

2005-01-11 14:47  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: item.py, renderer.py: Am now importing
	  Renderer and Item as BaseRenderer and BaseItem to resolve naming
	  conflicts and to allow the base classes to do some sanity/error
	  checking of the imported renderer modules (have they overridden
	  stuff they should have etc.).

2005-01-11 14:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Added some version information
	  output and am now importing the Scene from the base classes as
	  BaseScene.

2005-01-11 14:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: Added a rendererVersion number
	  global variable.

2005-01-11 14:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Reversed naming rule
	  whereby used Base as a prefix.  Using the Base prefix didn't
	  allow for error checking at the base pyvisi level to see if the
	  module has overridden all of the classes and methods it should
	  have.  One merely now has to import (within a renderer module)
	  the relevant base class as BaseClass so that there aren't naming
	  difficulties.

2005-01-11 14:42  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/common.py: Added pyvisiVersion variable

2005-01-11 14:42  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/__init__.py: Added (hopefully helpful) version output.

2005-01-11 14:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/__init__.py: Initial import to repository.  This
	  is the __init__ file so that python knows to treat this directory
	  like a module path.

2005-01-11 14:21  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/tests/: test_axes.py, test_camera.py,
	  test_image.py, test_item.py, test_plane.py, test_plot.py,
	  test_renderer.py, test_scene.py, test_text.py: Initial import to
	  repository.  These files are the tests from the pyvisi testsuite
	  (minus the gnuplot_lib and vtk_lib ones).  These are now the
	  vtk-specific tests and should be developed as such.

2005-01-11 14:18  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, item.py,
	  plane.py, plot.py, text.py: Changed the global variable renName
	  to rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:17  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/image.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Also changed the global variable renName to
	  rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:15  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/renderer.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Removed the _initRendererModule method as it is
	  now obsolete as there is no need for switching on what the
	  renderer is now; this is all handled by the module code.  Also
	  changed the global variable renName to rendererName because it's
	  more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:14  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Also changed the global variable renName to
	  rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:03  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, image.py,
	  item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Am
	  now using the renName variable in common.py to specific that this
	  is the vtk renderer, and this helps with the debugging output.
	  Will make this a coding guideline/standard.  Also added some
	  helpful comments and split up generic and module specific
	  imports.

2005-01-11 13:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: Dammit!  I should have kept
	  common.py around.  It turns out I found a good reason to use
	  renderer-specific options.  Duh.

2005-01-11 11:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, item.py, renderer.py, scene.py:
	  Changed all objects that need to inherit from the Base objects to
	  actually inherit from them.  Namely, Item, Scene and Renderer.

2005-01-11 11:51  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: common.py should only be part of
	  the base set of objects, and be inherited by all renderers.  Only
	  keeps debugging flags and stuff anyway.  If I change my mind in
	  the future, can always add it back in.

2005-01-11 11:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, image.py, item.py,
	  plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Trying out an
	  idea...  Am going to make all central classes named with the
	  prefix Base, ie Scene is now BaseScene, and so each module which
	  provides a Scene class must inherit from BaseScene.  Hopefully
	  this will allow me to do something like from pyvisi import *, and
	  then from pyvisi.renderers.vtk import * to get all of the vtk
	  overrides.  Will see what happens.  This is an attempt to
	  separate the individual renderer code from the base code.

2005-01-10 14:09  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Added common module in
	  axes.py and text.py, also fixed a print statement which needed an
	  if _debug in front of it for both of these files.  For all files
	  added the BASE: prefix to all of the debug output so that I know
	  what is being called when.

2005-01-10 14:01  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py: Prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.

2005-01-10 13:59  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/text.py: Fixed print statement only to print
	  if the _debug flag is set.  Also prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.  Importing the common module.

2005-01-10 13:53  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/axes.py: Importing common stuff now.  Fixed
	  _debug statement.

2005-01-10 13:52  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/axes.py: Fixed print statement only to print
	  if the _debug flag is set.  Also prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.

2005-01-10 13:36  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: __init__.py, axes.py, camera.py,
	  common.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py, text.py: Initial import to repository.  These files
	  were in the main pyvisi dir, but are being moved to a
	  vtk-specific location as part of separation of the code of the
	  different possible renderers.

2004-11-29 11:18  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Fixed bug caused by still explicitly
	  appending to renderer evaluation stack.

2004-11-26 15:29  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Tidied up some of the evalStack generating
	  code, am now using the interface function rather than setting the
	  variable directly.

2004-11-25 14:58  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/axes.py: Trivial change.

2004-11-25 14:54  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/camera.py: Trivial change.

2004-11-25 14:51  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/axes.py: Trivial formatting change.

2004-11-25 14:34  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/tests/test_item.py: Initial import to repository.  This is
	  a skeleton test file for the Item class.

2004-11-24 16:24  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/tests/: test_axes.py, test_camera.py, test_gnuplot_lib.py,
	  test_image.py, test_plane.py, test_plot.py, test_renderer.py,
	  test_scene.py, test_text.py, test_vtk_lib.py: Removed @brief tags
	  from docstrings as makes the source more compatible between both
	  doxygen and epydoc.

2004-11-24 16:20  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, image.py, plot.py, scene.py,
	  text.py: Removed @brief tags from docstrings as makes the source
	  more compatible between both doxygen and epydoc.

2004-11-24 15:29  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/axes.py: Removed @brief from documentation string.  This
	  means that the doc strings will be interpreted better by both
	  doxygen and epydoc.

2004-11-23 22:37  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: __init__.py, axes.py, camera.py, common.py, image.py,
	  item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py,
	  tests/test_axes.py, tests/test_camera.py,
