\chapter{Developing \pyvisi}
\label{chap:developingPyvisi}

In here should be docs on how people can contribute code, modules, renderers
etc to the pyvisi project.


\chapter{Objects and methods defined at base level}

Developers of \pyvisi renderer modules need to provide the classes, subclasses
and methods described below.  They need to be defined with stub classes or
methods even if that functionality is not supported by the rendering backend.
An error or warning message should be given if the user tries to call these
null methods or classes, however they need to be there for completeness.
